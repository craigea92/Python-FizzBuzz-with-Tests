# Python-FizzBuzz-with-Tests

## My Process
- Firstly, I began by learning about PyTest (Python Testing Suite).
- Once I had it installed, I wrote my first test and then a simple solution to the first test.
- I then wrote a further 2 more tests for Buzz & FizzBuzz.
- My final test is to check if numbers not disible by 3 and/or 5 would return themselves and this worked.

## Learnings
- I brushed up on my Python skills and learned how to implement tests, I had never done this in Python before.

## Technologies Used
- Languages & Frameworks - Python3
- Testing Framework - PyTest v6.2.5

## How to Install
In the command line:
- ```git clone https://github.com/craigea92/Pyhton-FizzBuzz-with-Tests```
